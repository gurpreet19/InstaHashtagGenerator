About The Project
InstaVibe Hashtags is a sleek, modern web application designed to help social media users, creators, and marketers generate relevant and trendy hashtags for their Instagram posts. By simply providing details about the post's location, mood, and content type, the app leverages the power of Google's Gemini API to instantly create a list of optimized hashtags, ready to be copied and pasted.

The project features a vibrant, gradient-based UI with a glassy, blurred background effect, making the user experience as visually appealing as it is functional.
